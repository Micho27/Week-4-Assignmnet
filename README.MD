**Week 4 Assignment** \n
This is the code I developed for the assignment in week 4 of the "Python Data Analysis" course on coursera. 

It analyses baseball data and provides several useful functions for this.

*  **filter_by_year**
This function takes in the batting statistics as nested dictionaries and returns
a list of them from the year specified.

* **top_player_ids**
Takes in data dictionary and returns the ID's of the top players according to the value
calculated by provided formula.

* **lookup_player_name**
Takes in data dictionary and list of tuples(with the playerId and compound stats) and will return a list of player names 
in strings in form of "X.XXX". i.e joe Bloggs returned as J.Bloggs.

*Will create highlight of the rest of functions soon*
